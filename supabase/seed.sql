(
  'Are your lawn care products safe for kids and pets?',

  'general', 3, true,

),
(
  'How does Colorado''s altitude and climate affect my lawn?',
  'Colorado''s combination of high altitude (5,000-7,500 ft along the Front Range), intense UV radiation, low humidity, alkaline clay soils, and extreme temperature swings creates a uniquely challenging environment for turf grass. Cool-season grasses like Kentucky Bluegrass and Tall Fescue do best here, but they need proper soil preparation, appropriate watering, and season-specific nutrient programs. That''s exactly what we specialize in.',

-- PRICING (5)
(
  'How much does lawn aeration cost in Colorado?',
  'Our core aeration service starts at $125 for a standard residential lawn up to 5,000 sq ft.

(
  'Are seasonal maintenance plans cheaper than individual services?',
  'Yes, our seasonal maintenance plans save you 15-20% compared to booking each service individually. The exact savings depend on your lawn''s size and the services included, but most homeowners save $200-400 over the course of a full year.

-- SERVICES (5)
(
  'When is the best time to aerate my lawn in Colorado?',
  'The ideal window for core aeration along the Front Range is early September through mid-October, when cool-season grasses are entering their strongest growth phase and the soil is still warm enough for root recovery. A secondary window exists in late April through May. Fall aeration pairs perfectly with overseeding because the open cores give seeds direct soil contact. We recommend avoiding summer aeration, as heat stress makes recovery difficult.',
  'services', 1, true,
  'aeration', NULL
),
(
  'What grass seed types work best at Colorado''s altitude?',
  'For most Front Range lawns between 5,000 and 7,500 feet, we recommend a blend of Kentucky Bluegrass (for density and self-repair), Tall Fescue (for drought tolerance and deep roots), and Perennial Ryegrass (for fast germination and fill). The exact ratio depends on your sun exposure, soil, and water availability. Shady areas may benefit from Fine Fescue additions. We never use warm-season grasses like Bermuda, which can''t survive Colorado winters.',
  'services', 2, true,
  'seeding', NULL
),
(
  'How often should I fertilize my Colorado lawn?',
  'Most Colorado lawns do best with 4-5 fertilizer applications per year: a light feeding in late April, a balanced application in late May, a summer maintenance dose in July (if irrigated), a fall growth application in September, and a winterizer in late October or early November. Over-fertilizing is a common mistake — it promotes shallow roots and increases water demand, which is the opposite of what you want in our semi-arid climate.',
  'services', 3, true,
  'fertilization', NULL
),
(
  'What pests should I watch for in my Colorado lawn?',
  'The most common lawn pests along the Front Range are white grubs (Japanese beetle and masked chafer larvae), billbugs, sod webworms, and clover mites. Grubs cause the most damage — they eat grass roots underground, creating dead patches you can pull up like loose carpet. Clover mites are more of a nuisance pest that invades homes in spring and fall. We recommend a preventive grub treatment in late May and targeted treatment for other pests as identified.',
  'services', 4, true,
  'pest-control', NULL
),
(
  'What does your seasonal maintenance plan include in winter?',
  'While your lawn is dormant from November through March, our seasonal plan includes a late-fall winterizer fertilizer application, final leaf cleanup, irrigation system blowout coordination (we''ll schedule with your irrigation company or do it ourselves if you prefer), and a winter dormancy assessment. In early spring, we''re the first ones out with pre-emergent weed control so crabgrass and spurge don''t get a foothold before your grass wakes up.',
  'services', 5, true,
  'seasonal-maintenance', NULL
),

-- SCHEDULING (5)
(
  'How far in advance should I book aeration in the fall?',
  'We strongly recommend booking fall aeration by mid-August. September and October are our busiest months, and slots fill up fast — especially on weekends. Seasonal maintenance customers get priority scheduling, so they''re locked in before we open the calendar to individual bookings. If you''re calling in late September, we can usually still fit you in, but you may have less flexibility on specific dates.',
  'scheduling', 1, true,
  'aeration', NULL

  'Can I schedule service for a specific day and time?',
  'We schedule by day rather than specific time windows. On your service day, our crews typically work between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM. We can accommodate morning-only or afternoon-only requests when possible, but we can''t guarantee exact arrival times due to the nature of route-based scheduling. You''ll receive a text notification when our crew is en route to your property.',
  'scheduling', 2, true,
  NULL, NULL
),
(
  'What happens if it rains on my scheduled service day?',
  'Light rain generally doesn''t affect our services — in fact, aeration and seeding actually benefit from moist soil. However, we''ll reschedule if there''s heavy rain, lightning, or standing water that would cause equipment to damage your lawn. If we need to reschedule, we''ll notify you by text and get you on the next available day, usually within 2-3 business days.',
