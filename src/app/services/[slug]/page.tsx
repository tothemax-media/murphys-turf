    descriptionParagraphs: [
      'Electrostatic disinfection is an advanced cleaning technology that provides superior surface coverage compared to traditional wiping or spraying methods. The electrostatic sprayer applies a positive electrical charge to disinfectant particles as they leave the nozzle. These charged droplets are attracted to surfaces and wrap around objects, coating them evenly on all sides including hard-to-reach areas that manual cleaning often misses.',

This method is particularly effective for facilities that require high levels of sanitation, including medical and dental offices, fitness centers, schools, and any building where infection control is a priority. The even coverage ensures that every surface receives the proper concentration of disinfectant for effective pathogen elimination.',
      'The electrostatic disinfection process is fast and efficient, allowing us to treat large areas in a fraction of the time required by traditional methods. A single technician with an electrostatic sprayer can disinfect an entire office floor in minutes, making it practical for regular application as part of your ongoing maintenance program. The disinfectant dries quickly and leaves no residue, so your facility can be occupied shortly after treatment.',
      'We recommend electrostatic disinfection as a complement to regular janitorial cleaning, not a replacement. While daily cleaning removes visible dirt and debris, electrostatic disinfection targets the invisible pathogens on surfaces that standard cleaning may not eliminate. For facilities in Sacramento, Murrieta, Walnut Creek, and throughout California, this service provides an extra layer of protection for the health and safety of your building occupants.',
