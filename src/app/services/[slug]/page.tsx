      'Electrostatic disinfection is an advanced cleaning technology that provides superior surface coverage compared to traditional wiping or spraying methods.

This method is particularly effective for facilities that require high levels of sanitation, including medical and dental offices, fitness centers, schools, and any building where infection control is a priority.

A single technician with an electrostatic sprayer can disinfect an entire office floor in minutes, making it practical for regular application as part of your ongoing maintenance program. The disinfectant dries quickly and leaves no residue, so your facility can be occupied shortly after treatment.',
      'We recommend electrostatic disinfection as a complement to regular janitorial cleaning, not a replacement. While daily cleaning removes visible dirt and debris, electrostatic disinfection targets the invisible pathogens on surfaces that standard cleaning may not eliminate.
