    descriptionParagraphs: [
      "All of our turf services begin with removing pet hair and waste along with any other debris such as leaves and branches. We will also run a magnet over the turf to remove any metal objects. After having removed the debris, we will use a de-weeding tool to get rid of any weeds from the edges and seams of your turf.",
      "Pet hair and debris removal is the foundational step in every Murphy's Turf cleaning service, and for good reason. Over time, your artificial turf accumulates far more than meets the eye. Pet hair weaves itself into the turf fibers, fallen leaves decompose and create a layer of organic matter that promotes weed growth, and small metal objects like bottle caps, nails, or staples can become hidden hazards for bare feet and paws alike. In Murrieta and across the Inland Empire, the warm Southern California climate means your outdoor turf sees year-round use, which accelerates the buildup of hair, waste, and organic debris between the synthetic blades.",
      "Our trained technicians use specialized tools designed specifically for synthetic turf surfaces. The process starts with a thorough visual inspection to identify problem areas, followed by systematic removal of all pet hair and solid waste from the entire turf surface. We then clear leaves, twigs, and any other organic debris that has settled into the fibers. A powerful magnet sweep follows to extract any metallic objects hidden within the infill — a step that is especially important for families with children who play on the turf. Finally, we use precision de-weeding tools to pull any weeds that have taken root along the edges and seams of your artificial lawn, where organic matter tends to collect and create ideal conditions for weed germination.",
      "Regular debris removal prevents the cascade of problems that neglected turf faces: compacted infill, weed infestations, drainage issues, and unsanitary conditions for pets and children. By starting every service with this critical step, we ensure that any subsequent treatments — whether blooming, disinfecting, or deodorizing — can penetrate the turf properly and deliver maximum effectiveness. For homeowners in Murrieta, Temecula, Menifee, and surrounding communities, this service is the foundation of a healthy, beautiful artificial lawn that performs the way it was designed to.",

These items settle into the infill and become invisible but can cause cuts and injuries to bare feet, children, and pets. Our magnet sweep is a quick safety measure that catches these hidden hazards every time we service your turf.',

      {
        question: 'Can pet hair really damage artificial turf?',
        answer:
          'While pet hair will not damage the turf fibers themselves, accumulated hair traps moisture and organic matter that promotes bacterial growth and unpleasant odors. It can also contribute to infill compaction, which affects drainage. Regular removal keeps your turf hygienic and functioning properly.',

    descriptionParagraphs: [
      "The purpose of re-blooming turf is to help bring back the life in your turf after having been worn out. Over time when your turf is being frequently walked on, it can cause the blades to become matted down. During this process we utilize our machines to clean-up and remove any caked debris from the fibers of the turf while also using them to fluff the turf blades and bring them back to life standing upright like natural grass would.",
      "Artificial turf is engineered for durability, but it is not immune to the effects of daily use. In Murrieta and throughout the Inland Empire, where outdoor living spaces are used nearly year-round thanks to Southern California's mild climate, synthetic turf takes a beating. High-traffic pathways, play areas where kids run and tumble, and spots where pets repeatedly lounge all develop visible wear patterns over time. The turf blades flatten, the infill compacts, and what once looked like a lush green lawn starts to resemble a worn carpet. This is where Murphy's Turf blooming and de-compacting service makes a dramatic difference.",
      "Our blooming process uses commercial-grade power brushing equipment specifically designed for synthetic turf. These machines work at the fiber level, lifting each blade back to its original upright position while simultaneously loosening and redistributing the infill material that has compacted beneath the surface. Compacted infill is one of the most common and overlooked problems with artificial turf — when the infill packs down, it reduces the turf's ability to drain properly, makes the surface feel harder underfoot, and accelerates blade matting. Our de-compacting process breaks up these compressed layers, restoring proper drainage and the soft, cushioned feel your turf had when it was first installed.",
      "During the blooming service, we also extract caked-on debris that has worked its way deep into the turf fibers — material that standard raking or leaf blowing simply cannot reach. This deep cleaning component is what separates professional blooming from DIY brushing. After the service, we perform a full post-service inspection to ensure even infill distribution and consistent blade height across your entire turf area. Homeowners are consistently amazed at the transformation — turf that looked years past its prime suddenly looks freshly installed. For properties in Murrieta, Temecula, Wildomar, Lake Elsinore, and the surrounding communities, regular blooming extends the life of your artificial turf investment by years and keeps it looking its best through every season.",

During your service, our technicians will assess your turf and recommend the ideal schedule.',

In fact, regular blooming actually protects your turf by preventing the kind of prolonged matting that can lead to permanent fiber memory — where blades lose the ability to stand upright at all.',

        question: 'What is the difference between blooming and just raking my turf?',
        answer:

Our commercial power brushing works at the fiber level, extracting embedded debris, loosening compacted infill, and lifting individual blades from the base. The results are dramatically more thorough and longer-lasting than anything achievable with a rake or push broom.',

          'In most cases, yes. We have restored turf that has gone years without maintenance back to near-original condition. However, turf that has been severely neglected may have some permanent fiber memory in the most heavily worn areas. The sooner you start regular blooming, the better the long-term results.

It cuts past the top synthetic turf layer, into the infill where bacteria & viruses live, and attacks the contaminants at their source. OxyTurf will penetrate the synthetic turf, clean & kill 99.9% of germs & bacteria in just minutes, all without any hazardous chemicals.",
      "If you have pets — or even if you do not — your artificial turf is harboring more bacteria than you might realize. Every time a dog urinates on synthetic turf, the liquid passes through the blades and settles into the infill layer below. In Murrieta's warm Southern California climate, heat accelerates bacterial growth and amplifies odors, turning a minor issue into a persistent problem that surface-level rinsing cannot solve. Bacteria, viruses, and the ammonia compounds from pet urine thrive in the warm, moist environment beneath your turf's surface, and no amount of hosing down the top layer will reach them. That is exactly why Murphy's Turf relies on OxyTurf — a professional-grade solution specifically formulated to penetrate past the surface and attack contaminants where they actually live.",
      "The OxyTurf power-spray process is thorough and systematic. Our technicians apply OxyTurf across the entire turf surface using commercial spraying equipment that ensures complete, even coverage. The solution is designed to cut through the synthetic turf layer and soak into the infill, where it goes to work immediately — killing 99.9% of germs and bacteria in just minutes. Unlike household cleaners or DIY solutions, OxyTurf does not simply mask odors. It neutralizes the bacterial source of the smell, replacing it with a clean, fresh grass scent. The result is turf that does not just smell better for a day or two — it stays fresh because the underlying cause of the odor has been eliminated.",
      "What makes OxyTurf stand out from other turf cleaners is what it does not contain. OxyTurf uses stabilized accelerated hydrogen peroxide as its active ingredient, which means no bleach, no ammonia, and no harsh chemical residues. Many competing turf cleaners rely on bleach or ammonia-based formulas that can irritate skin, weaken turf fibers over time, and leave behind chemical odors that are unpleasant for both people and pets. With OxyTurf, your turf is safe for pets and children to use as soon as it dries — typically within 30 to 60 minutes depending on weather conditions. For families in Murrieta, Temecula, and throughout the Inland Empire who want a genuinely clean and safe outdoor surface, our disinfect and deodorize service delivers peace of mind along with a dramatically fresher yard.",

      "It's important that we clean-up after our pets as their waste is not only an unruly sight but also harmful to the environment and people around you. Surprisingly, according to the EPA, pet waste is very toxic and is even a polluter within the same category as oil. Pet waste when not properly disposed can contain a vast array of different bacteria and parasites that can not only make people sick but even your own pet as well. In terms of how often you should pick up poop is based on how many dogs you have. With one it could be doable to do it once a week but if you have multiple it may be necessary to do it once a day. We understand that some people are too busy to deal with the poo and much rather spend their time playing with them than picking up after them. That's why we decided to provide several service plans dedicated to waste removal so you can keep your yard looking fresh while saving more time to spend with your fluffy friends.",
      "Pet waste on artificial turf presents a unique set of challenges that natural grass does not face. On a natural lawn, rain and soil microbes eventually break down waste over time — though the health risks remain. On synthetic turf, pet waste sits on or within the infill layer with nowhere to go. In Murrieta's warm climate, the heat accelerates decomposition and bacterial growth, intensifying odors and creating an increasingly unsanitary environment with each passing day. The bacteria and parasites found in pet waste — including E. coli, salmonella, giardia, roundworms, and hookworms — can survive in your turf for weeks or even months, posing a genuine health risk to your family, your pets, and even your neighbors.",

Our technicians arrive on your scheduled day, systematically walk your entire turf area, and remove all pet waste from the surface. After removal, we sanitize the areas where waste was found to reduce bacterial contamination and keep your turf hygienic between full disinfecting treatments. All waste is bagged and disposed of properly — you never have to deal with it. We offer flexible scheduling that adapts to your household's needs, whether that means weekly visits for a single-dog home or daily service for multi-pet families.",

          'It depends on the number of pets in your household. For one dog, weekly service is usually sufficient. For two or more dogs, twice-weekly or even daily service may be necessary to keep your turf clean and odor-free. During your first visit, we will assess your situation and recommend the ideal schedule.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you sanitize the turf after removing waste?',
        answer:
          'Yes. After removing all pet waste, we sanitize the affected areas to reduce bacterial contamination. This surface sanitizing is included with every poop scooping visit and helps maintain turf hygiene between your scheduled full disinfecting treatments.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens to the waste you collect?',
        answer:
          'All pet waste is double-bagged and disposed of properly by our team. You do not need to provide bags, bins, or handle any part of the disposal process. We take care of everything from start to finish.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I combine poop scooping with other turf services?',
        answer:
          'Absolutely. Many of our clients pair scheduled poop scooping with monthly or bi-monthly disinfecting and deodorizing treatments for complete turf maintenance. We can build a custom service plan that covers all your needs at a frequency that works for your household and budget. Contact us for a free quote.',

    metaDescription:
      "Murphy's Turf cleaning services are powered by OxyTurf — a proven synthetic turf cleaner, disinfectant, and deodorizer. No bleach, no ammonia, safe for pets and kids. Serving Murrieta, CA.",
    descriptionParagraphs: [
      "Murphy's Turf's cleaning products are powered by OxyTurf. Specifically formulated for use on turf in mind, OxyTurf is a proven synthetic turf cleaner-deodorizer that eliminates germs and bacteria while replacing them with the smell of fresh real grass. Formulated containing stabilized accelerated hydrogen peroxide as compared to other turf cleaners, OxyTurf doesn't use any bleach or ammonia in their products as those chemicals can leave residues on turf that can irritate skin, weaken turf, and leave a mystery odor on your artificial grass, turning it from a safe-zone to a hazard-zone for your pets and kids.",
      "When we founded Murphy's Turf, we knew that the cleaning products we chose would define the quality and safety of every service we deliver. After extensive research and testing, we selected OxyTurf as the backbone of our cleaning process because it meets every standard we demand: proven effectiveness against bacteria and viruses, complete safety for families and pets, compatibility with all synthetic turf types, and zero harmful residues. OxyTurf is not a general-purpose cleaner repurposed for turf — it was engineered from the ground up specifically for synthetic turf applications, and that purpose-built design makes all the difference in real-world performance.",
      "The science behind OxyTurf centers on stabilized accelerated hydrogen peroxide, or SAHP. This active ingredient delivers powerful antimicrobial action — killing 99.9% of germs and bacteria on contact — while breaking down into water and oxygen after it has done its job. There are no chemical residues left behind, no lingering fumes, and no compounds that could irritate sensitive skin or harm pets who roll on the turf. Compare this to bleach-based turf cleaners, which can fade the color of your synthetic grass, degrade the fiber structure with repeated use, and leave behind chlorine residues that are irritating to both people and animals. Or ammonia-based products, which produce harsh fumes and can actually worsen urine odors by chemically reacting with the ammonia compounds already present in pet waste. OxyTurf avoids all of these problems entirely.",
      "Beyond its cleaning and disinfecting power, OxyTurf leaves behind a fresh, natural grass scent that homeowners consistently love. Instead of a chemical smell that announces 'this turf was just cleaned,' your yard simply smells like fresh-cut grass — the way an outdoor space should smell. This deodorizing effect lasts well beyond the initial treatment because OxyTurf eliminates the bacteria that cause odor at the source rather than masking the smell with fragrances. For Murphy's Turf clients across Murrieta, Temecula, and the greater Inland Empire, OxyTurf is not just a product — it is our commitment to delivering artificial turf cleaning that is effective, safe, and genuinely enjoyable. Every service we perform, from routine maintenance to deep sanitization, is powered by this trusted formula.",

      },
      {
        question: 'How long does the fresh grass scent last?',
        answer:
          'The fresh grass scent typically lasts one to three weeks depending on weather conditions, pet activity, and overall turf usage. Because OxyTurf eliminates the bacteria that cause odor rather than just masking the smell, the deodorizing effect lasts significantly longer than spray-on fragrance products.',
